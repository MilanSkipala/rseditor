      First, all given control points are arranged into a column, which is the left-most one in the figure. For each pair of adjacent control points, draw a south-east bound arrow and a north-east bound arrow, and write down a new point at the intersection of the two adjacent arrows. For example, if the two adjacent points are ij and i(j+1), the new point is (i+1)j. The south-east (resp., north-east) bound arrow means multiplying 1 - u (resp., u) to the point at its tail, ij (resp., i(j+1)), and the new point is the sum.
      Thus, from the initial column, column 0, we compute column 1; from column 1 we obtain column 2 and so on. Eventually, after n applications we shall arrive at a single point n0 and this is the point on the curve. The following algorithm summarizes what we have discussed. It takes an array P of n+1 points and a u in the range of 0 and 1, and returns a point on the BÃ©zier curve C(u).

      Input: array P[0:n] of n+1 points and real number u in [0,1]
      Output: point on curve, C(u)
      Working: point array Q[0:n]

      for i := 0 to n do
          Q[i] := P[i]; // save input
      for k := 1 to n do
          for i := 0 to n - k do
              Q[i] := (1 - u)Q[i] + u Q[i + 1]; return Q[0];
